Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

Example:
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.

When a number is not a prime, this number can be factored into two factors namely a and b 
i.e. number = a * b. 
If both a and b were greater than the square root of n, a*b would be greater than n.
