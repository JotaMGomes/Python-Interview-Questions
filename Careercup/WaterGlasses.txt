You can put water to only top glass. If you put more than 1 litre water to 1st glass, water overflow and fill equally both 2nd and 3rd glass. 
Glass 5 will get water from both 2nd glass and 3rd glass and so on..
If you have X litre of water and you put that water in top glass, so tell me how much water contained by jth glass in ith row.

Example. If you will put 2 litre on top.
1st - 1 litre
2nd - 1/2 litre
3rd - 1/2 litre
