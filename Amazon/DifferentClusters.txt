Downtown CityA consists of city blocks, represented as grid of M*N blocks.
Each block represents either building denoted by 1 or open land denoted by 0.
Adjacent blocks with value of 1 are considered clusters of buildings.
Diagonal blocks with value 1 are not considered part of the same cluster.
Write an algorithm to find the number of different clusters in CityA.

Input:
rows;    an integer representing the number of rows in the grid.
columns; an integer representing the number of columns in the grid.
grid;    a two-dimensional integer array representing downtown CityA.

Output:
An integer representing the number of different clusters in CityA.

Example 01:
Input:
rows = 5
columns = 4
grid = 1 1 0 0
       0 0 1 0
       0 0 0 0
       1 0 1 1
       1 1 1 1

Output:
3
